        Should you pay a debt that has gone to collections?

        If you need your savings, don’t feel compelled to pay the consumer debt,
        nor firesale your assets. Regardless, debts are tortious for standing by
        the borrower for force majeure ($12k/64 new debt/cash U.S. per person)
        and third party donee beneficiaries whom actually have the cash
        promised, and will be reversed by (cash/debt)*income that will be the
        last before 1/12 industry-vertical as “collateral” max-royalty to become
        subservient to customers of labor-borne-demand.

        “Tortious,” means you can sue for “force majeure,” that means
        foreseeable impossible intent. After “reverse” amortization, future
        debts will be organized in a way that disburses return to the business
        account by 1/12 NAICS industry designation, for “standing” or the
        ability to sue on “laundering grounds,” or dodging max-royalty, which is
        an “operational rate” as opposed to time-based, so that you await
        customers instead of take credit as income.

        Mind you, I am a developer for bookkeeping software, that believes a
        transaction-fee based currency is the future - now that USD is fungible
        for treasury inventory (at least 23% of oil-wells in America are
        “federally-leased” back to us through corporations instead of dollar
        royalty and drilling sign off, to be subservient to customers). Debt is
        the cause of inflation, that is the rationale that the Federal Reserve
        provides for raising rates. Why do that pennywise short for a pound
        cowardice? Just work for demand in real time without a money ‘market’ by
        “collateral” as NAICS industry-designations as tortious for revenue for
        max-royalty, undisbursed.

        "With poverty defined as the bottom 20% of earners, how can you
        eliminate poverty, since there’s always a bottom 20%?"
        <br />
        You are describing income inequality, not poverty with numeration as
        inflation

        to be thrice food, income.
        <br />
        <br />
        A percentile of an absolute (income), rather than a ratio (poverty), is
        skewed by concentration-of-presentation, alone; however, poverty
        thresholds flatten percentile of a ratio to a distribution, forged by
        despondency from said threshold. The base calculation uses a third of
        income on FCSU.
        <br />
        <br />
        We can end poverty by adjudicating contract law over surrendered
        freedoms so 1/hour-GDP/p is maximized as labor is variable part of
        sprints with material, and we can lessen income despondency.

        Why does the division of labor increase the economy's level of
        production?
        <br />
        If production is 1/hour-GDP/p:
        <br />
        <br />
        Competition, by 1/12 industry-vertical, provides for inelasticity by
        1/hour-GDP/p efficiency (0y/1x), of even the most elastic markets,

        Not only does the division of labor necessarily provide, unto,
        substitutive-vertical lines of production, it also, does so, by
        complementary-horizontal designs of life, or living costs. Short answer:
        skill-sharing (a.k.a. “comparative advantage”). The delegation of labor
        does not increase consumption/expenditures/income, it only increases
        efficiency and equates Supply with Labor-Demand, along the 1/hour-GDP/p
        plane, which, in fact, should decrease price (y).

        "Supply is low, prices rise - it is just Supply and Demand," well supply
        is material and labor, price and hour.

        <hr ref={this.supply} />
        The snapshot of the Supply and Demand plane has no representation of
        physical resource supply, just potential trade for hours, 1/hour-GDP/p,
        unless relative. If relative to another point in time, it is a leftward
        movement of ordered-propensities to meet MUI by
        ask-bid-inventory-opportunity, for this, or other markets, in which
        lower Supply makes Demand average utility cost traded, higher, less
        traded - not raise price when Supply is in a loward-shift - price is an
        effect of trade and propensities. Yet, if Demand is elastic, all Demand
        consumes at the scarce price, and yet-still-for competiton will
        lowardly-shift, even perfectly-elastic Demand.
        <br />
        <br />
        Leftward supply is matched by demand when scarcity breeds competition,
        and a drop in price does so for both. A leftward shift in supply
        propensities may be for a substitute fungible-currency-bid becoming
        cheaper or a compliment fungible-currency-bid becoming expensive (when
        both, elastic, weak is no relation for inventory bid nor opportunity
        cost).

        Nick Carducci - Candidate at U.S. Senate (2020–present)
        <br />
        Increasing the economy by measure of GDP/p is tech deprecation, by
        actual or nominal increase in Demand, which is a dead-weight-box upon
        GDP/hour-GDP/p 0y/1x efficiency, so you would just tax more than free
